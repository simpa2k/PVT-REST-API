POST    /login                      controllers.SecurityController.login
POST    /logout                     controllers.SecurityController.logout

GET     /swipingsessions            controllers.SwipingSessionsController.getSwipingSession(initiatorEmail, buddyEmail)

# Suggestions for further swiping session endpoints:

# POST  /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=&buddyEmail=                                     initiates a new swiping session, returns list of activities to choose from
# PUT   /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=&buddyEmail=&(initiatorChosen=||buddyChosen=)    records chosen activities for the specified user

# Note that all of these endpoints currently only handle two users. This is, of course, easy to fix JSON-wise but might
# require a bit more thinking when it comes to persisting everything in the database.

# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.versioned(path="/public", file: Asset)
