                                    THE LIST
===============================================================================

* Implement swiping session functionality.

    * Suggestions for further swiping session endpoints:

      POST  /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=email1&buddyEmail=email2
      Initiates a new swiping session, returns list of activities to choose from.

      PUT   /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=email1&buddyEmail=email2&initiatorChosen=[activity1, activity2]

      Or:

      PUT   /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=email1&buddyEmail=email2&buddyChosen=[activity1, activity3])
      Records chosen activities for the specified user.

      Note that all of these endpoints currently only handle two users. This is,
      of course, easy to fix JSON-wise but might require a bit more thinking when
      it comes to persisting everything in the database.

    * Priority: 1.
    * Time: 4 hours.

===============================================================================

* Add documentation.

    * For:
      * SwipingSessionsController
      * models.User
      * models.SwipingSession

    * Priority: 3.
    * Time: 2 hours.

===============================================================================

* Improve documentation.

  * For:
    * SecurityController
    * Secured
    * FacebookSecurityController

  * Priority: 4.
  * Time: 2 hours.

===============================================================================

* Integrate server and database with data from the public API's.

    * Will involve:
      * Updating fields in models.SwipingSession.

    * Priority: 1.
    * Time: 8 hours.

===============================================================================

* Make FacebookSecurityController record more data than just basic user data.

  * Will involve:
    * Determining what data to gather and store. It is probably a good idea to
      let the client dictate this.
    * Update fields in FacebookData accordingly.

  * Priority: 1.
  * Time: 4 hours.

===============================================================================

* Use Jackson's deserialization mechanism instead of manually setting all
  attributes of FacebookData objects in FacebookSecurityController.buildFacebookData

  * Priority 4.
  * Time: 3 hours.
