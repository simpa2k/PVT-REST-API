                                    THE LIST
===============================================================================

* Implement swiping session functionality.

    * Suggestions for further swiping session endpoints:

      POST  /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=email1&buddyEmail=email2
      Initiates a new swiping session, returns list of activities to choose from.

      PUT   /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=email1&buddyEmail=email2&initiatorChosen=[activity1, activity2]

      Or:

      PUT   /swipingsessions?initiatorEmail=email1&buddyEmail=email2&buddyChosen=[activity1, activity3])
      Records chosen activities for the specified user.

      Note that all of these endpoints currently only handle two users. This is,
      of course, easy to fix JSON-wise but might require a bit more thinking when
      it comes to persisting everything in the database.
